# Seq2Seq-Model
A neural machine translation model, based on Long Short Term Memory RNNs (LSTMs) and Attention Mechanism, and incorporating an Encoder Decoder model architecture, to translate sentences (Natural Language) from German to English language. The model gave decent translations for short to moderate length sentences, with the Attention Mechanism being beneficial for moderate length sentence translations. Below is the loss curve of the model.
